Project Title: Wheels-Holo Connect
Wheels-Holo Connect is a prototype video call application designed to simulate a drive session where users can dynamically join video calls from their own positions, creating an immersive and interactive communication experience. Utilizing holographic technology and AWS services, this project showcases the fusion of cutting-edge communication and automotive technology. Whether it's hosting a virtual meeting while on the move or connecting with friends and family during a drive, Wheels-Holo Connect offers a glimpse into the future of in-car communication.
